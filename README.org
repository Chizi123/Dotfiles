#+TITLE:My dotfiles
#+AUTHOR:Joel Grunbaum

Pretty straightforward dotfiles for my programs.
This is pretty much only for the programs where I have changed the dotfiles or they require generated ones.
There is also my Aspell dictionary, which should be periodically updated.

My Emacs config is linked to from here to its own repository.
I would suggest making sure it is the latest version if you choose to use it.

The dotfiles are managed using GNU Stow and can be restored using make.
Just use ~make home~ to set up the files.
If only part of the dotfiles are wanted, they are grouped into various parts I think make sense.
Have a look at the makefile for the groups.
Credit to Peter Zuger for the idea, his dotfiles can be found [[https://gitlab.com/peterzuger/dotfiles][here]].
