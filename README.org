#+TITLE:My dotfiles
#+AUTHOR:Joel Grunbaum

Pretty straightforward dotfiles for my programs.
This is pretty much only for the programs where I have changed the dotfiles or they require generated ones.
There is also my Aspell dictionary, which should be periodically updated.

My Emacs config is linked to from here to its own repository.
I would suggest making sure it is the latest version if you choose to use it.

The dotfiles are managed with an install script ~INSTALL.sh~ and a given config can be installed with ~INSTALL.sh [config]~.
Some of the configurations have dependencies, which will also be setup.
The overall repository can be cloned with ~git clone https://github.com/Chizi123/Dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles~, and must be located in =~/.dotfiles= for automatic updating to work.
The installer will ask what to do if it encounters a file conflict when installing, but also does this when encountering an already installed config (Needs to be fixed).
